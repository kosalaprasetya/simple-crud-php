# Employee Management

This is a simple PHP application I write to help me learn the basics of PHP and MySQL. The app provides basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, allowing users to manage records in a MySQL database.

- **Tech Stack:** Native PHP, PDO, MySQL
- **Features:**
  - Add new employee records
  - View all employees
  - Update existing employee details
  - Delete employee records

This project is ideal for beginners looking to understand how PHP interacts with MySQL using PDO for secure database operations.
